 I’m a research computer engineer . My expertise includes project design and management ,and the development and implementation of research tools.  
 my thesis project meets the requirements of human detection in a drone video as :
 
- it can detect multiple humans from moving cameras that hovering at variant heights

## the fundamentals of a good developer mindset
This mindset will help you make better decisions in your daily programming journey.
Here are some of the key points that every developer must master:
- The Purpose of Software : you should understand the purpose of the software is To help people.
- The Goals of Software Design:So there are two key points here: Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
- (Mis)understanding :you should fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.
- Simplicity : A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.
- Complexity: Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
- Maintenance :It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation...
